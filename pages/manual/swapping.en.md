## Swapping tokens

Token swap lets you exchange one token with another. Here you do not need to place orders and have an order taker to trade with you. Rather, you trade with the liquidity pool. Therefore, you can get your tokens almost instantly thanks to Wanchain’s fast speed and low fees.

In the next figure, you can see how it works.

At the bottom, you can see more details on the transaction. Here you can see the minimum you will always receive, the price impact in the pool, and LP fee, and the route that will get you the best price for your trade.

If the price impact is high, you might want to put in a smaller amount at first.
