## Yield Farming

In the next section in the top bar, ‘Farm’, you can stake the liquidity tokens from the previous section into WanSwap’s yield farming platform.

Select the pool which you have provided liquidity, and click on “Deposit” or “Manage”. This will bring you to the management page which is seen in the next figure. Here you can deposit your WSLP tokens. Click on the deposit button.

Click on ‘Max’ to put in all the tokens. The first time you need to approve first. This will be done in your wallet. After approving click on ‘Deposit’ and confirm again in your wallet.

By depositing liquidity to the Farm, you get WASP tokens in return. The reward of WASP tokens will be calculated based on your liquidity token amount and staking time, i.e., staking a larger amount of WLSP for a longer time will get you more WASP tokens. The WASP token is at the center of the WanSwap platform and economics. It will be used as a governance token and for other purposes.

You can claim your WASP by clicking on the ‘Claim’ button. This will only claim the WASP accumulated.

If you withdraw from farming all WASP accumulated will be claimed automatically.

After withdrawing you will get back your WSLP tokens. These are needed to pull from the liquidity pool. You will now see the details of your liquidity on the pool tab again.
